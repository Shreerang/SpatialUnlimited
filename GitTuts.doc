Github is a very popular tool used by developers as a code versioning system. I too have been using git for some time and have been asked how to use it by many of my junior developers. Filly I am putting together the most basic things that you should know to start with Git and use it without any issues.

Setting up your git

1. First things first. Login to github.com, create your profile and download git for your machine - either Windows, Mac or Linux.

2. You will get Git Bash and Git GUI that are installed.









3. Create a repository on Github.










Using the Git Bash

1. Open the Git Bash prompt.
2. Check the location where your local git repo would be created
pwd

This would generally be /c/Users/admin. In case you want to change this location and move to D: drive, type

cd d:

This will change your current location to D: To check you can again type:

pwd

3. Once you are in your desired folder type the command

git init

This command will tell Windows that the current folder is now git track-able.

4. Now create a dummy file which you would like to add to your repository. Let's say a readme doc. Type in the following command

touch Readme.doc

This command will create a new empty file "Readme.doc" at your current location.
5. Now type in the following command.

git status

The prompt will show that the file "Readme.doc" is not track-able. (get exact error message from git prompt). This is because you did not tell git that this file is to be tracked.
6. For the file to be tracked you need to add it to your local repo. You can do this with the next command.

git add Readme.doc

Now the file has become track-able.

7. You can now commit this file to your local repo using the next command

git commit -m "Dummy readme file added" Readme.doc

This will commit this file Readme.doc with a commit message "Dummy readme file added"
8. However at this point you haven't synced your local repo to your repo created on the Github site. To sync these 2 repos you need the next command

git remote add origin <path to your repo.git - https://github.com/username/repo.git>

Note: You need to code in your own git link in the above command

9. You now need to push your changes from the local repo to the Github repo. To do this, the next command is:

git push -u origin master

This command will ask you for your Github username and password before commiting your changes to the master branch.
